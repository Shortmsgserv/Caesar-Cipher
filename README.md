# Caesar-Cipher
I used the walkthrough to create a Caesar Ciper at Code Club (https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/secret-messages/) and then added the ability to input the key as well as the ability for the ciper to preserve upper case and lower case characters.

The aim of this project was to not only increase my familarisation of Python, but to also make use of Github commits via the command line.
